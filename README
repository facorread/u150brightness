This program sets the screen brightness of the Lenovo U150 laptop. I have not tried it in other systems, and it will surely not work because it uses hardcoded PCI references.

Compile this C++ program with

g++ -o brightness brightness.cc

Move it to /usr/local/bin/, set the SUID permission and then add keyboard shortcuts for the command in your desktop environment:

brightness up
brightness down
